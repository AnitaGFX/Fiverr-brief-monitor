# Fiverr Brief Monitor Chrome Extension

A comprehensive Chrome extension that monitors Fiverr brief matches and provides intelligent notifications with AI-powered analysis capabilities.

## Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Automatic Brief Checking**: Monitors https://www.fiverr.com/briefs/overview/matches every 1-10 minutes
- **Smart Detection**: Uses multiple detection methods for maximum reliability:
  - Text content analysis ("No new brief matches..." detection)
  - Button counting (`aria-label="View brief"` buttons)
  - Interactive element detection (`aria-label="Not interested"` buttons)
- **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**: Checks page without disrupting your current browsing
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Different notification types based on confidence levels

### Notification System
- **Confirmed Briefs**: "Hurry! You have X new briefs!" (when 2+ detection methods confirm)
- **Potential Briefs**: "You may have some new briefs!" (when only 1 detection method triggers)
- **Smart Throttling**: Prevents notification spam (5-minute cooldown)
- **Badge Counter**: Shows brief count on extension icon

### AI Integration (Future-Ready)
- **Project Analysis**: Analyze brief complexity, competitiveness, and requirements
- **Proposal Generation**: AI-powered proposal drafting
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere
- **Customizable Prompts**: Tailored analysis based on your skills and preferences

## Installation

### Method 1: Developer Mode (Recommended)

1. **Download Extension Files**
   - Save all the provided files in a folder named `fiverr-brief-monitor`
   - Ensure you have these files:
     - `manifest.json`
     - `background.js`
     - `content.js`
     - `popup.html`
     - `popup.js`
     - `ai-integration.js`
     - `config.js`

2. **Create Icon Files**
   - Create an `icons` folder inside your extension directory
   - Add icon files: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
   - You can create simple icons or download from icon libraries

3. **Load Extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select your `fiverr-brief-monitor` folder
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Method 2: Package and Install

1. **Create Extension Package**
   - In Chrome extensions page, click "Pack extension"
   - Select your extension directory
   - This creates a `.crx` file and `.pem` key file

2. **Install Package**
   - Drag the `.crx` file to Chrome extensions page
   - Confirm installation

## Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. **Click Extension Icon**
   - The Fiverr Brief Monitor icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar
   - Click it to open the popup interface

2. **Enable Monitoring**
   - Toggle "Enable Monitoring" to start watching for briefs
   - Choose your preferred check interval (1 minute recommended)

3. **Test the System**
   - Click "Test Check Now" to verify everything works
   - Visit https://www.fiverr.com/briefs/overview/matches to ensure you're logged in

### Advanced Configuration

#### AI Integration Setup (Optional)

1. **Get API Key**
   - Sign up for OpenAI API access at https://platform.openai.com/
   - Generate an API key from your dashboard
   - Other supported providers: Anthropic, Cohere

#### Monitoring Intervals

Choose based on your needs:

- **1 minute**: Recommended balance
- **2-5 minutes**: Conservative, good for long-term monitoring
- **10 minutes**: Minimal impact, suitable for passive monitoring

## How It Works

### Detection Logic

The extension uses a three-tier detection system:

1. **Text Analysis**: Searches for "No new brief matches..." text
2. **Button Detection**: Counts "View brief" buttons
3. **Action Detection**: Counts "Not interested" buttons

### Notification Logic

- **3 checks passed**: High confidence → "Hurry! You have X new briefs!"
- **2 checks passed**: Medium confidence → "Hurry! You have X new briefs!"
- **1 check passed**: Low confidence → "You may have some new briefs!"
- **0 checks passed**: No briefs available

### Background Monitoring

- Extension creates background tabs only when necessary
- Existing Fiverr tabs are used when available
- Background tabs are automatically closed after checking
- No interference with your active browsing

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Stay Logged In**: Ensure you're logged into Fiverr for accurate results
2. **Browser Notifications**: Allow notifications for the extension
3. **Multiple Tabs**: Keep Fiverr briefs page open in a pinned tab for fastest checking
4. **Regular Breaks**: Don't rely solely on automation - manual checks are still valuable
